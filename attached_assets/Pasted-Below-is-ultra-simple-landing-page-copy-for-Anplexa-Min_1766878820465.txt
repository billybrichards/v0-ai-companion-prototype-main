Notes on intent (not shown on page)
	•	Page should feel like a whisper, not a pitch
	•	Dark mode by default
	•	No testimonials yet (add later)
	•	No stock photos — pure typography + subtle motion
	•	Cursor blink / waveform animation adds life without distraction

If you want, next logical steps are:
	•	ultra-short onboarding screen copy (first 30 seconds)
	•	AI’s first message (this matters more than anything)
	•	age-gate microcopy that doesn’t kill mood
	•	variant for App Store / Web App splash

This page is built to convert curiosity into action without triggering fear or shame.
